**Selected Experience**
🤖 **Open Source Contributions**
I have experience contributing to Arena Bench a large open-source project for robotic obstacle avoidance using Deep Reinforcement Learning.

Moreover, I have published a respective paper at the IROS conference and in the Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L) journal.

📜 Reimplementing and Reproducing Papers
I have experience with independent research. I have implemented the Reward Constrained Policy Optimization paper into stable-baselines3 PPO and reproduced the original results by running and tracking experiments.

To accompany this work, I have submitted a blog post to the ICLR Blogposts Track communicating the paper’s theory and my results.

Feel free to look at my specific portfolio entry.

👨🏻‍🔬 **Professional Experience**
Currently I am working as a Student Researcher at the Reliable Multimodal AI Lab at the TU Darmstadt under the supervision of Prof. Marcus Rohrbach working on Generative Video-Language Modelling. Additionally, I have professional experience working as an Applied Machine Learning Student Researcher at the Fraunhofer Heinrich Hertz Institute.
There I worked on dynamic traffic flow forecasting using Graph Neural Networks.

📚 **Teaching and Community Contributions**
To further contribute to the Machine Learning community, I have a YouTube and Medium channel where I publish educational Machine Learning content.
